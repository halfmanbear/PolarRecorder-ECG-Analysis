# Polar Recorder

Polar Recorder is an open-source application designed for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts who need to capture raw biometric signals from Polar devices. It provides a simple way to record, store, and stream physiological data.

## Features

- **Records Raw Data** – Capture signals such as ECG, PPG, and heart rate from Polar sensors
- **Supports All Polar Devices** – Compatible with all Polar hardware capable of streaming raw data (tested with H10, H7, and OH1+)
- **Flexible Data Storage** – Save recordings to a file for offline analysis
- **Live Data Streaming** – Transmit data in real-time via MQTT
- **Event Logging** – Mark timestamped events during a recording to annotate moments of interest
- **Resilient** – Auto-reconnects on connection failures and continues the recording
- **Fully Open Source** – Developed with transparency and collaboration in mind

## Installing

Polar Recorder is available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wboelens.polarrecorder). You can also download the APK directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/boelensman1/polarrecorder/releases) section and install it manually on your device.

## Using the app with Polar Watches
The app supports data streaming from Polar watches, however, specific setup steps are required. See [the official Polar documentation](https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk/blob/master/documentation/UsingSDKWithWatches.md#step-by-step-how-to) for step-by-step setup instructions.

## Code Examples

The `code_examples/` directory contains sample code for processing recorded data in Python and R. More examples will be added over time, contributions are welcome!

## ECG Analysis & Reporting

The `external_output_processor/` directory contains a Python toolkit for analyzing ECG recordings exported from the app. It detects R-peaks, computes time/frequency/non-linear HRV metrics, flags arrhythmias and ectopic beats, and generates an interactive standalone HTML report. See [external_output_processor/README.md](external_output_processor/README.md) for usage.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

Kotlin sources are formatted with [ktfmt](https://github.com/facebook/ktfmt) **0.61**. Please run `ktfmt .` from the `app/` directory before submitting a PR so the diff stays clean.
